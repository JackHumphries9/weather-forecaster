<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

I came across the [Remotion](https://remotion.dev) project and I was immediately inspired. I thought, what about a weather forecast which automatically is uploaded to social media and I developed this. It automatically renders a video every day with data from the Met Office API and uploads it to YouTube. (I want to add more in the future such as Instagram and Tiktok).

You can checkout the videos [here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbXyETL8qMedIdeZ1-IK0Rg)
